            "content": "I am dealing with time series data every day. So, the first Python module I want to mention is datetime which provides basic classes for dates and time manipulation. . I am helping several international markets with forecasting, but most of the time I don’t need to worry about time zone or daylight saving time, etc. If you are interested in the datetime type that include such information, you can learn more about it from the documentation. . In this post, I will introduce several basic classes and class methods in datetime module that I use the most frequently. . Of course, to use this module, we first need to import it: . import datetime . datetime() . One useful class in datetime module is datetime(). When instantiating, the arguments, year, month and day are required, and the others are optional, for example: . datetime(year, month, day[, hour[, minute[, second[, microsecond[,tzinfo]]]]]) . This instantiates a datetime object which has these attributes: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, and tzinfo. For example, the following code returns the datetime object: . dt = datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 1) dt . datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 1, 0, 0) . The following code is how we can access it’s year, month and day attributes, and you can access the other attributes using the dot notation. They are all integers. For example: . dt.year . 2021 . dt.month . 6 . dt.day . 1 . date() . Another class that I use frequently is date(). It is very similar to datetime() class, but when we instantiate it, it only takes three arguments: year, month, day. They way to access it’s attribute is the same as that of datetime objects. For example: . dt = datetime.date(2021, 6, 1) dt.year . 2021 . date() class has a today() method, it does not take any arguments, but return the today’s date in local time: . datetime.date.today() . datetime.date(2022, 2, 7) . strftime() and strptime() . Sometime we need to convert date/datetime objects into string format or vice versa, which is when strftime() and strptime() come in handy. date/datetime objects have a strftime() method that converts them into strings, in a format that we can specify. For example: . dt = datetime.date(2021, 6, 1) #create a date object dt.strftime(&#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) #convert the date to string . &#39;2021-06-01&#39; . “%Y”, “%m”, and “%d” are format codes. For example, with “%Y” you are telling the strftime() to convert the year into format of “2021”. You can read more details about the format codes here. If we want the date string in the format of “June-01-21”, we can use format code of “%B-%d-%y”: . dt.strftime(format=&quot;%B-%d-%y&quot;) . &#39;June-01-21&#39; . strptime() is a class method of datetime objects. So, to use this method, you need to call: . datetime.datetime.strptime(datetime_in_str, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) . For example: . datetime.datetime.strptime(&#39;2021-06-20&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) . datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 20, 0, 0) . One thing to remember is that strptime() does not take keyword arguments, which means we need to provide the date in string format as the first argument, and the format code as the second argument, and we don’t give any names to the arguments like we did for strftime (e.g. dt.strftime(format=&quot;%B-%d-%y&quot;)). . That’s it for the datetime module from me. Hope you it is helpful to some of you! .",

I think it would be interesting if I make my notes public, which is why I am creating this blog. I will spend a couple of minutes everyday and write about something I have learned. Hope some of my blogs can be helpful to some of the data people. . I have interesting background. I have a PhD focusing on Functional Genomics, which is how I became fascinated by data. I then decided to get another master’s degree in Information Systems because I wanted to learn more about data analytics. I landed a job as data &amp; forecast analyst because of this master’s degree. . I am using Python and Excel every day in my work. So, this blog will be focusing on data analytics using Python and maybe some Excel. I will also include some SQL and techniques for data visualization. .",
