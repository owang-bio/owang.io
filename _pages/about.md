My name is John Doe, and I am currently working as a data & forecast analyst. I have been learning data analytics every day and taking notes using Microsoft OneNote. I think it would be interesting if I make my notes public, which is why I am creating this blog. I will spend a couple of minutes everyday and write about something I have learned. Hope some of my blogs can be helpful to some of the data people.

I have interesting background. I have a PhD focusing on Functional Genomics, which is how I became fascinated by data. I then decided to get another master’s degree in Information Systems because I wanted to learn more about data analytics. I landed a job as data & forecast analyst because of this master’s degree.

I am using Python and Excel every day in my work. So, this blog will be focusing on data analytics using Python and maybe some Excel. I will also include some SQL and techniques for data visualization.
